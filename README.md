Note: The dataset is not re-uploaded here to respect Kaggleâ€™s terms of use.

 Tools Used

- SQLite (using DB Browser for SQLite)
- SQL (standard queries and views)
- Kaggle dataset
- Screenshots captured and compiled into a PDF

SQL Techniques Demonstrated

- 'SELECT', 'WHERE', 'GROUP BY', 'ORDER BY'
- Aggregate functions: 'COUNT', 'SUM'
- Subqueries
- Creating and using 'VIEWS'
- Query optimization techniques
- Basic JOINS (not used here due to missing Teams table)
